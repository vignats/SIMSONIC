This project aims to characterize the degradation of the endosteal interface to quantify the state of cortical bone. The project is divided into two parts: the definition of the parameters that describe the bone and the study of the specular index regarding these defined parameters.

#Bibliography
Contains relevant articles and Amadou S. Dia's thesis.

#Parameters Definition
Contains the MATLAB programs needed to obtain the parameters from the ex-vivo images.

#Simulation Software
Contains the SIMSONIC software and the programs used to generate the files needed to use SIMSONIC, as well as programs to post-process the data and obtain the specularity map. 
NB : The datas simulations are contain in the calculSSD directory.

#Results Analysis
Analysis of the data obtained from the post-processing of the SIMSONIC data to obtain the metrics to analyze the specularity map. The analysis of the ex-vivo results is also included in this file.
